# Projection Mapping in Processing

This code was part of an installation for a short exhibition in which I was featured. It is the working prototype of a projection mapping software, written in and executed via the [Processing IDE](https://www.processing.org/). The visual effects can be programmed in a linear timeline. The software also implents a feature to ineract with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
